* LeanDog: Brought in as an expert on ATDD for iOS, but then did most of the work on Android.
* Delivered Points for Groupon with small team on small hardware in short timeframe.
* Shifted the narrative at Groupon to break down purchasing resistance that caused massive delays to Groupon projects.
* Pushed Central Park project @ 2U to deliver _anything_!
* Pushed Central Park project to strip the process parts that do not pay off.
* Argued against centralization of contracts for EDM (Enterprise Data Model). (2U)
* Pushed for a single Authn system to speed development and reduce users' papercuts. (2U)  (Separation of interface/implementation.)
* Points project: generative testing for correctness.
* Used Kanban @ Micros: found all the work was stuck in QA.
* At Micros: Versioned and checked the DAS configs, and learned aobut statistical control, and brought QA failures down dramatically to improve flow.
* @ Cronosys: The original reason I adopted TDD: A feature we'd been accused of "breaking" more than once, when in fact there were two stakeholders with opposite requirements, but we never talked about the feature with both stakeholders fewer than a few months apart, so we didn't realize what was happening.
* @ Cronosys: Pre-"agile", we delivered the login page in 1 week, after 1 year of planning by previous consultants who made a database diagram.
* Bootcamps @ 2U:
** External consultants controlled the software stack, and there was no documentation anywhere, including in the codebase.
** Management wanted us to have expertise on this code in-house.
** I was hired to understand how the software worked.  This was somewhat adversarial.
** The first PR, adding CI, took 7 weeks and management intervention to get approval.  A lot of listening and reassuring.
** Next bit was getting the system into Kubernetes and using CD.  There were at least two prior attempts, sabotaged by the contractors.  A lot more patience, advocacy, organizational entrenchment, hidden motives.  The organizational entrenchment involvedc arguing against basic practices like CI, saying they were bad and they knew the only way to make scalable software.
* Blue Frog
** Made a testing/simualtion framework for our game which allowed us to test the interaction of game mechanics.  It found quite a few bugs, but also found shorter solutions to some of our puzzles which were legitimate but we didn't know about.
** Testing for Hearts and Spades, along with network services.
* Cronosys:
** Betting on web technology for business apps was huge, even though it wasn't the best technology, we knew it would take over.
