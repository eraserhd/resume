   Hello!

   I'm a hands-on (read: coding) Principal Engineer who can engage with
   and build trust with business, mentor junior engineers, and bring up teams.

   I'm competent with Elixir and Phoenix, expert in PostgreSQL and SQL, expert in AWS,
   expert in JavaScript, and passable in Python.
   I definitely have the technical chops for this role.

   In the past I've done some work on Groupon's ad bidding system, adjacent to the machine learning
   and prediction team. I have kept up on these topics since taking the first round of Andrew Ng's
   machine learning (ML) MOOC in 2012, and I understand how LLMs, agents, and embedding databases work.

   At 2U, I worked briefly with a ML-based system for routing leads.  I also consulted on
   an core AI-based learning assistant.

   I'd love a chance to talk about this position.
