I'd like you to extract between 3 and 8 "relevant skills" from the following job description and format them in LaTeX according to this example:

<output>
\input resume.tex
\relevantskill{Go}{}
\relevantskill{TypeScript}{}
\relevantskill{Backend}{}
\relevantskill{OAuth/JWTs}{}
\relevantskill{PK Cryptography}{}
\relevantskill{Up and Down Stack}{}
\relevantskill{Many Users}{}
\relevantskill{Small Fast-moving Teams}{}
\makeresume
</output>

* The best "relevant skills" to extract are ones specific to the job -- avoid "boilerplate" skills.
* Do NOT include the <output> </output> tags in the output.
* Do NOT include markdown code blocks or other framing.
* DO include the `\input resume.tex` and the `\makeresume` lines.
* Each \relevantskill line has the same structure:
** `\relevantskill{`
** The text of the relevant skill.
** `}{}` -- note the lack of spaces between these curly braces.
* Avoid unnecessary words.  Use short phrasing (to avoid word wrapping in the final document).


Here is the job description:
