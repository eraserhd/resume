   Hello!

   I think you'll see from my resume my enthusiasm for improving software delivery
   at scale:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item Implementing CI/CD from end-to-end for inherited services.
   \item Building new tools for mobile CI/CD.
   \item Facilitation and mentoring to uplevel the team.
   \item Advocacy for organizational change when the tech organization is misaligned with delivery goals.
   \end{itemize}

   As a Principal Engineer, I've owned many products and initiatives.  The most
   common comment I've gotten from management is, "I appreciate that I don't have to manage
   you."

   I would love an opportunity to discuss this role!
