Cedar is seeking a Senior Software Engineer to be a core contributor on our Communications Platform squad within the Patient pillar.

    Design and deliver scalable solutions: Architect and implement robust, reusable solutions for new features and enhancements across the entire stack, always with an eye toward sustainability, monitoring, and addressing technical debt.
    Champion engineering excellence: Uphold and elevate code quality standards through thoughtful code reviews, create high-quality design documents (problem statements, proposed solutions, alternatives, tradeoffs, effort/complexity/maintainability), and establish processes for safe changes (QA, testing frameworks).
    Drive impact and innovation: Actively identify and advocate for opportunities to deliver significant impact within your squad, proposing new standards and investing in future technical improvements.
    Mentor and elevate: Proactively unblock peers, provide direct and constructive feedback, and actively mentor junior engineers, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth.
    Collaborate strategically: Work seamlessly with design, product, and integrations partners, challenging requirements respectfully when necessary to ensure the best possible outcomes.
