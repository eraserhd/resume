We're on a mission to revolutionize the CAD industry by developing the world's most advanced hardware design infrastructure and tools. Mechanical CAD is in the dark ages, and hardware demands have outpaced today's hardware design infrastructure. The industry is due for a refresh, and we're laying the foundation for a modern hardware design toolkit so that you can create new design tools never before possible.

We are headquartered in Los Angeles, CA with both a local and remote team. We were founded and incubated by Embedded Ventures in 2021.

About You

We're looking for curious, innovative, and ambitious self-starters to join our lean and growing team to help us bring our mission to life. We think you'll thrive on our team if you're:

    Curious at your core, with an eagerness to learn and do things differently
    Customer-focused, always thinking about ways to improve the user experience
    Able to operate autonomously and work asynchronously, while also being an effective team player 

About The Role

We're looking for a Software Engineer to help design and implement our own file format. Most CAD and graphics file formats are lossy in one way or another and we aim to create the file format for modern learning about previous file formats, their problems, edge cases, reverse engineering undocumented file formats, and finding and solving undocumented behaviors. We are a small startup so there are lots of opportunities to add a lot of value and design systems that will scale with the company in the future.

What You'll Do

    Help design, develop, optimize, and debug our intermediate file format
    Implement conversions to and from existing file formats
    Develop import and export capabilities from our CAD engine
    Reverse engineer and implement conversions for undocumented file formats
    Debug and optimize performance issues related to file import and export in our systems
    Document functionality and implementation details for production and other engineers
    Improve code quality and test coverage

What You'll Need 

    Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field
    Proficiency writing software in Rust, modern C++, or a similar native programming language
    Confidence with higher-level mathematical concepts such as:
        vector calculus
        numerical methods for optimization
    Experience with CAD or graphics file formats (e.g., STEP, IGES, DXF, STL, OBJ, GLTF)
    Experience with Git or a similar version control system
    Experience working on a production system
    Familiarity with writing bindings to/from native libraries (e.g., C bindings for a Rust or C++ library)
    Strong ability to communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Nice to Have 

    Experience with any of the following:
        parametric boundary representations
        spline curves and surfaces
        3D graphics libraries (e.g., Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL)
        computational geometry
        manufacturing
        topology
        contributing to open-source projects
