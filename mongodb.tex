  Hello!

  In addition to the technical requirements mentioned in the job posting, I also
  have about six years working directly with payment systems, including implementing
  protocols, certifying software, troubleshooting issues, and working according to
  PCI Data Security Standard.

  In the past, I've become the go-to person for distributed debugging.  My storied
  past gives me a large pattern book of failure modes, and I'm often (not always, obviously)
  able to give good advice before even digging into logs and code.

  I'd love a chance to apply that knowledge at MongoDB!
