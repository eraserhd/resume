   Hello!

   I'm a top-tier, weathered engineer who knows how to get projects delivered in
   challenging environments while mentoring engineers and building organizational
   capability. Bringing up code standards is a big part of my daily push, especially
   testing, which I've given several talks on.

   I have collaborated with data science, ML, frontend, API teams, product,
   infrastructure, and the customers themselves.  Working to ensure all stakeholders'
   needs are met is normal for me.

   Additionally, I'm familiar ML models and how to operationalize them..

   I have not worked with the regulations for medical devices, though I have worked
   under HIPAA, SoX, and PCI-DSS regulations for various projects.
