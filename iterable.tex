  Hello!

  I'm a hands-on (read: coding) tech leader who mentors and brings up
  engineers while building projects.  I've successfully run many
  challenging projects and I'm definitely the person who barrels
  through roadblocks to get things done.

  For exmaple, my most recent project required coordination with five
  squads and, each partly staffed with contractors who had a stake in
  {\it not} coordinating, since they believed it would hurt their bottom line.
  This project was challenging, but ultimately successful.

  Or the Groupon Points program, which had many documented challenges
  but delivered on time and succeeded.

  On Scala, I know that I've written it before, but I can't for the life
  of me remember where.  In any case, I'm deeply familiar with its
  underlying principles from other languages.
