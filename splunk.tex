  Hello!

  I'm an experienced hands-on (read: coding) principal engineer who has been a tech lead on many, many projects.

  I've built many systems, some of them distributed, and have been the person brought in to debug
  the worst of the worst unexplainable problems--including quite a few that were latent for years
  and blamed on external circumstances.

  I naturally end up mentoring in every position, largely because I have a super broad background and am approachable.
  When necessary, I build presentations and socialize ideas that can improve our organization technically.

  Some of Splunk's software I've used and deeply appreciated in the past, and I'd love an opportunity to work
  on it and with the teams.
