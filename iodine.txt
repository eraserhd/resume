Recognized as one of Austin’s best places to work, we are a collaborative and dedicated team with innovation built into our DNA. Iodine is an enterprise AI company that is championing a radical rethink of how to create value for healthcare professionals, leaders, and their organizations - by automating complex clinical tasks, generating insights and empowering intelligent care. Powered by one of the largest sets of clinical data and use cases available, our groundbreaking clinical machine-learning engine, Cognitive ML, constantly ingests the patient record to generate real-time, highly focused, predictive insights that clinicians and hospital administrators can leverage to dramatically augment the management of care delivery.

    Design and implement automated end-to-end, performance, load, scalability, and security tests
    Collaborate with business, product, and engineering teams to understand the product vision and requirements
    Champion for quality to be driven into the product from the start
    Set and drive expectations around quality for each product release
    Create test plans, analyze test results, and create test data scenarios
    Document and track defects to closure
    Ensure that production defect root causes are analyzed and addressed in a timely manner
    Improve processes and tools that help shape the quality framework within the team and across the organization
    Conduct in-depth technical and performance analyses in support of production issue troubleshooting
