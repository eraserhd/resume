  Hello!

  This job sounds exactly like me!

  Throughout my career, I've built out internal platforms while also delivering production,
  customer-facing systems.  My long experience delivering these customer-facing systems,
  as well as my storied experience in different environments, has been invaluable in
  figuring out what Platform to build to give engineers delivery leverage.

  I'd love a chance to discuss this role!
