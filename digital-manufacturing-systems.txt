Digital Manufacturing Systems (DMS), digitalmanufacturingsystems.io, is a rapidly growing manufacturing technology startup founded in 2020 by experienced manufacturing technology industry veterans who came from highly successful manufacturing startups. We are creating unique and highly scalable manufacturing focused product offerings that help our customers accelerate their manufacturing using cloud based technologies and advanced automation solutions, and we are looking to grow our Engineering Team!

DMS is seeking a Lead Full Stack Engineer to join our team as an integral part of our growing Engineering organization where technology is the backbone of the company. You will be reporting to our CTO and playing a key role in advancing our technology roadmap for our 2D and 3D Cad web based tools and integrations as we grow our proprietary and modern web-based technology platform. In this role you will lead the design and implementation of new features and capabilities while working directly with our internal users. You will also build, grow, and learn alongside other Software and Devops Engineers on a team implementing modern software architectures building manufacturing solutions using the latest and best of class cloud based commerce tools and frameworks.



About You

You are a self-starting Lead Full Stack Engineer with a bias towards action, and you are a forward thinker who can play a lead role breaking down technical problems and business requirements into components and tasks that you can lead others through quickly and iteratively.
