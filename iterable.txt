We’re looking for a strong Senior Backend Engineer to join a cross-functional product engineering team building next-generation experiences within Iterable’s platform. In this role, you’ll lead complex, high-impact projects from inception to delivery—working across team boundaries, navigating ambiguity, and shaping technical direction with minimal oversight.

This is a great opportunity for someone with a strong product mindset who thrives on end-to-end ownership, enjoys solving real-world problems, and is excited to explore new capabilities like large language models (LLMs) and agentic workflows—even if you haven’t worked on AI-focused systems before. While AI is not the core focus of this role, we’re increasingly looking to incorporate intelligent, assistive features into user-facing experiences, and you’ll have the chance to help identify and prototype those opportunities.

One of our core values is a growth mindset and Iterable is a company where everyone can grow. If this is a role that excites you, please do apply as we value applicants for the skills they bring beyond a job description.

How you will make a difference:

    Independently drive large-scale backend projects across multiple stakeholders and teams.
    Collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to deliver features that improve usability, scale, and customer value.
    Own the full lifecycle of features—from discovery and design to implementation, deployment, and support.
    Contribute to architectural discussions and technical decisions that raise the bar for engineering excellence.
    Prototype applications of LLMs and agentic patterns, and help lay the groundwork for scalable, developer-friendly integration.
    Provide technical mentorship through code reviews, pair programming, and design discussions.

We are looking for people who:

    5+ years of backend software engineering experience, ideally in a SaaS environment.
    A track record of leading projects with multiple contributors and stakeholders.
    Proficiency in modern backend languages—Scala and/or Java preferred.
    Experience working with distributed systems and databases such as Elasticsearch, Postgres, Redis, or CockroachDB.
    A product-minded approach—comfortable working closely with PMs and designers and weighing trade-offs across usability, performance, and complexity.
    Curiosity and adaptability when working in new domains or learning new technologies.
    Excellent communication and collaboration skills in a remote environment.

Bonus Points

    Experience with or interest in generative AI, LLMs, or agentic design patterns Strong intuition for user experience and product quality—even in backend-heavy roles
    Background in building customer-facing product features or tools for non-technical end users
    Familiarity with event-driven architecture, message queues like Kafka or Pulsar, and high-scale distributed systems
    Exposure to full-stack development or close collaboration with frontend teams
    Prior experience in a remote-first or highly distributed engineering team
