The Senior Software Developer plays a critical technical role on our professional services projects, capably executes all the responsibilities of the Software Developer typically being responsible for either particularly complex subsystems or an entire technical delivery team. He or she is tasked with large, project-level development estimation efforts against speculative scopes, definition of delivery team technical practices and processes, detection and correction of insecure coding patterns and implementations, anticipation of performance and scalability bottlenecks, and consistent delivery of production-ready code. The Senior Software Developer contributes to deployment architecture design, collaboratively triages and debugs production issues, and recommends production deployment, monitoring, and support services and toolsets.

This role may require periodic short-term travel to conferences, seminars, and client sites up to 25% of the time.
