  In addition to all of the technical experience particulars (outlined and highlighted on my resume),
  I'd like to point out my six years of working on credit authorization software on my resume -
  the two jobs Datavantage and Micros Retail.

  This involved implementing wire protocols for credit, check, and debit authorization
  services according to specs in multiple formats, from XML to ISO8583 to custom text and binary
  formats and ensuring the software passes certification, as well as choosing failure modes that were
  less consequential and dealing with cryptography and security and multithreading concerns, and
  ensuring no loss of data or precision in common representation.

  This experience seems very analogous to energy market communication.

  "Reduce chaos in our engineering team" is the sort of requirement that speaks volumes - and might
  be a warning to most applicants!  However, the top bullet at 2U was exactly that.  This was a
  challenging but rewarding part of my career that required technical skill, but also advocacy and
  understanding others' perspectives, in order to bring this acquired tech stack up to speed in
  terms of reliability, testability, zero-down-time deploys, and allowing teams to deploy independently.
