  Hello!

  I've logged over 20 years in Java -- in a plethora of languages, actually, but Java keeps
  coming back.  I'm definitely super competent in it.

  This position is interesting, as this "Connectors" work seems similar to my past credit
  authorization work, which required new protocol implementations for each processor to be
  quickly delivered within the framework of the software.

  I have distributed systems expertise, most relatedly building jobs for Apache Spark for
  reporting workloads in the past.  I'm also deeply familiar with SQL on a syntax/compiler-
  theory level, and have used this knowledge in the past to parse and rewrite SQL queries
  on the fly and build GraphQL filtering that can build general SQL queries.  Those things
  seem deeply related.

  I only maintain a few small Open Source projects, but I contribute to many, fixing bugs
  I encounter and adding features that I need as a philosophical matter.

  I hope we can talk about this position!
}
