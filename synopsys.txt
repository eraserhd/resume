You Are:

You are a highly skilled Principal DevOps Engineer with a passion for modernizing and optimizing build and deployment infrastructure. You find joy improving developer efficiency and transitioning legacy systems to modern scalable environments, exceling in collaborating with cross-functional teams to streamline and automate development workflows. Your expertise in C/C++ development environments, combined with your deep knowledge of version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and dependency management, makes you an invaluable asset to any engineering team. You thrive in dynamic environments where problem-solving and continuous improvement are part of the daily routine. Your strong communication skills and ability to mentor junior engineers ensure that best practices are followed across the board.

What You’ll Be Doing:

    Lead the migration of large C/C++ monorepos from Perforce to GitHub, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing development and build processes.
    Work with engineering teams to break down monolithic repositories into manageable, modular components suitable for Github and modern version control practices
    Design, implement, and maintain CI/CD GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and deploying C/C++ applications (primarily) and Java, Python, Node.js etc
    Oversee and manage Conan integration within the CI/CD pipeline for C/C++ dependency resolution and package management.
    Work with infrastructure teams to design and implement the necessary container-based infrastructure.
    Collaborate with developers, QA engineers, and security teams to ensure the build and deployment pipeline is fully integrated with testing, monitoring, and security processes.
    Continuously monitor CI/CD pipelines, ensuring they are stable, efficient, and fast. Track pipeline performance metrics and identify areas for optimization.

The Impact You Will Have:

    Improve developer efficiency, modernizing the build and deployment infrastructure, enhancing scalability and efficiency.
    Streamline the software delivery process, reducing build times, optimizing infrastrucure and improving reliability.
    Implement modern dependency management practices, ensuring secure and efficient package management.
    Enhance collaboration across teams, ensuring seamless integration of development, testing, and deployment workflows.
    Drive continuous improvement in DevOps processes, fostering a culture of innovation and excellence.

What You’ll Need:

    10+ years of experience in DevOps or Build Engineering, with at least 3+ years working in C/C++ development environments.
    Strong expertise in Python, RESTful APIs, and other relevant technologies for building scalable platforms.
    Experience migrating from Perforce to GitHub or similar version control systems.
    Hands-on experience with Conan as a C/C++ package manager, dependency resolution and integration into build systems.
    Extensive experience with GitHub Actions, including creating complex CI/CD workflows for C/C++ applications.

Who You Are:

    Strong knowledge of CMake, Make, or other build systems for C/C++ projects.
    Proficiency in scripting languages like Bash, Python, or similar to automate tasks and workflows.
    Familiarity with Docker and container-based deployment workflows.
    Experience working in On-prem data centers and understanding of cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) and infrastructure automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
    Strong knowledge of Git and version control best practices.
    Strong communication and collaboration skills, capable of working with cross-functional teams including developers, QA engineers, and system administrators.
    Ability to mentor and guide junior engineers in best practices for build automation, version control, and DevOps processes.
