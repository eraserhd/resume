   Hello!

   I've owned, designed, or rolled out many of the features in your posting in the past: A/B testing,
   feature flagging, configuration management, as well as observability.  I've built many
   high-performing services and microservices and delivered them on time.

   I'm also able to work autonomously--and it usually ends up that way because I can do it and
   managers have so many things to manage.

   I'd love a chance to talk about this position!
