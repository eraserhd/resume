    Filesystem as a foundational abstraction makes absolute sense to me,
    and is an idea that I implemented by exporting my favorite editor's
    internal state using Plan 9's 9P filesystem protocol
    (the PR is here: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/pull/3116 ).
    Obviously, this example isn't high-performance or distributed, but
    it does show a lot of foundational concepts and implements the full
    protocol.

    The idea of building AI on top of something like this is exciting.

    Aside from that, you are describing a tech stack that I'm deeply
    familiar with.  I specifically have been an expert in PostgreSQL and
    its tuning and query optimizing for years and years, and even
    contributed to early unsuccessful PostgreSQL replication project
    in the middle 2000s.  I used Node.js extensively at Groupon and
    2U, and worked on several recent Typescript projects.

    At 2U, I was responsible for migrating a poorly designed set of
    microservices into Kubernetes, along with implementing
    CI/CD, blue/green deploys, horizontal scaling, and bringing the
    code quality up to organizational standards.  At Groupon, I designed
    high performance services that processed all user interactions (web
    and mobile) from the Kafka "firehose" to animate a points ticker on
    the homepage in very-near-realtime.
