Weâ€™re working with a venture-backed startup thatâ€™s rethinking how SQL performance should work at scale. Their product is a drop-in SQL cache that dramatically reduces query latency â€” no code changes required. It's built for developers who care about speed, efficiency, and simplicity.


Theyâ€™re looking for experienced engineers with a strong background in query optimization to join their small, senior team. Youâ€™d be working on challenging problems at the core of their SQL engine â€” turning complex queries into efficient, maintainable dataflow graphs, and helping build out a truly novel caching layer for modern applications.


This is a fully remote role (North America only), with flexible hours and a collaborative, engineering-driven culture.


What youâ€™ll be doing:

    Designing and building core components of the query planner and optimizer.
    Writing production-grade systems code (mostly in Rust).
    Representing parameterized SQL queries as dataflows and optimizing them for performance.
    Collaborating with other experienced engineers on architecture, product direction, and design decisions.
    Balancing research-driven work with practical engineering.


What theyâ€™re looking for:

    3+ years of hands-on work with SQL query optimization, query planning, or database internals.
    Strong understanding of relational algebra, compiler concepts, and performance tuning.
    Comfortable working in systems languages like Rust, C/C++, or Go.
    Experience with distributed systems, streaming, or caching is a plus.
    Someone who enjoys working on deep technical challenges and building clean, scalable systems.


Why this team?

    Youâ€™ll work on real query optimization problems with production impact â€” not just theoretical research.
    The engineering culture values autonomy, learning, and real ownership.
    They offer strong comp, equity, unlimited PTO, and 90 days of parental leave.
    Youâ€™ll join a sharp, low-ego team solving meaningful problems in data infrastructure.


ðŸ“¬ If this sounds interesting, feel free to DM or reach out directly â€” happy to share more about the team and what theyâ€™re building.
