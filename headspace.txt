    Provide a point of escalation for engineering teams facing complex technical challenges.

    Define coding standards, development processes, and best practices to ensure high-quality software development across engineering.

    Stay abreast of emerging technologies, industry trends, and best practices, evaluating their potential application and driving innovation within the software engineering and tech team broadly.


What you will bring:

Required Skills:


    10+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a proven track record of building and scaling production-grade APIs and distributed backend systems.

    Deep expertise in system design and software architecture, with the ability to decompose complex problems into scalable, maintainable components.

    Extensive experience with Node.js and TypeScript, especially in the context of building high-scale backend services.
