  Hi!

  I'm an engineer who's been in senior/principal roles for the last 12 years, and
  I have extensive payment system expertise:

\begin{itemize}
\item I wrote a system called Auth21 from scratch.
\item I maintained a different C++-based system called DAS, and a Java-based system called XPay.
\item I implemented processors and protocols for all three systems - credit, debit, check, and ACH.
\item I worked in, and debugged issues in, PCI-DSS compliant environments.
\item I've implemented and corrected usages of third-party APIs since then.
\end{itemize}

  I also have experience working on modern, scaled systems.  The Groupon Points system was required
  to handled 6000 TPM and was pre-tested for load prior to Groupon's dreaded Starbucks deals. (It
  always passed.)

  I'd love a chance to discuss this role.
