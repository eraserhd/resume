   Hello!

   I'm excited about the opportunity to join Cents as Engineering Lead. Your mission to revolutionize the laundry industry through technology resonates with me -- I love working on problems that make a real difference, especially for startups.

   My experience building and scaling systems at 2U, leading teams at Groupon, and architecting event-driven platforms aligns perfectly with what you're looking for. I've successfully:

   - Led teams of 3-8 engineers while remaining hands-on with code
   - Built resilient, scalable systems handling millions of transactions
   - Designed APIs and event-driven architectures using Redis and queue systems
   - Implemented complex third-party integrations and data synchronization
   - Worked extensively with TypeScript, React, and Node.js in production

   I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can mentor engineers, contribute to architecture decisions, and help drive product roadmap execution. The combination of technical leadership and hands-on development at Cents would be an ideal fit.

   I'd love to discuss how my experience can help Cents continue its impressive growth!
