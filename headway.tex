  Hello!

  I'm a senior engineer with a ton of experience designing, leading, building, and scaling
  systems, mentoring engineers, and solving critical delivery blockers.

  I've built many services on AWS, have worked with Spark and Kafka, PagerDuty and DataDog,
  am an expert on Postgres and competent with Redis, and have a broad set of language skills
  across many stacks.

  I'd love a chance to talk about this position!
